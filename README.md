# Stemming-and-Part-Of-Speech-POS-tagging

In this assignment you will demonstrate your understanding of dynamic memory allocation, linked data structures, and search algorithms. You will further extend your skills in program design and implementation.

Text analysis and understanding is becoming prevalent in our daily lives. For example, intelligent personal assistant apps such as Apple Siri and Google Now process user requests by first converting voice to text with a speech recognition algorithm, and then analysing the text and finding answers to the requests. Finally, the answers found are read out by a text to speech (TTS) algorithm.
To help computers understand a sentence, there are a few standard preprocessing steps. Two preprocessing steps of interest in this assignment are called stemming and Part-Of-Speech (POS) tagging.
